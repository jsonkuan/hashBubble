Project Idea: hashBubble

The primary feature of the project is to allow a user to enter a hashtag into a web application and to display relevant thumbnail images and/or video to the user. The user will be able to apply various filters to the results, such as location and language. The results will be displayed in bubbles that the user can interact with to view the full sized image or watch the video. The results will be displayed in a steady stream of bubbles that float up the screen, giving the user limited time to pick out the images that interest them most. Users of the application will also be able to blow selected bubbles to each other.

The application will initially pull images from Instagram only with the intention to expand this to include other sources once a working version of the web app exists. 

The project will be run using scrum methodology and will utilise the following:
Trello - project management tool
GitHub
Riak
Erlang
Javascript, html and css
